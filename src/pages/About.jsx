                            Hi! My name is Elena Nguyen.
                            <br/><br/>
                            I love to express myself through arts and communicate new ideas
                            as a computer science student at SFU. Currently, I'm very inspired by immersive 
                            digital spaces, so expect something of the likes coming soon ;).
                            <br/><br/>
                            When I'm not doing any of the above, I like to play piano, make donuts, and 
                            go on walks with my dog Luka (he's the cutest).
